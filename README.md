# fridge

fridge consists of container objects whose values can self-destruct
after a certain period of time. Like a cache, it's designed to store
data which should never be served if it's past its expiration date.

To use fridge, copy the 'fridge' folder to somewhere Python can find it.
Then type 'import fridge' at the top of your code.

Right now, the module only contains one class: minifridge.
See minifridge.ipynb for a demo.
